This board makes use of the Quectel L80-R GPS module with integratred ceramic patch antenna and the CH340 USB-to-UART IC, to allow the GPS module to be powered from a micro-USB connector and serial GPS data to be received on a connected computer. A simple python script is included in the repository for receiving the serial data and parsing it to extract speed, time, latitude/longitude etc.
